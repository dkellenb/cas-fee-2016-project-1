###Technical features
* The Application uses a REST-API on a node.js server for storing notes in a nedb.
  *It is possible to send your websocket id through the rest interface. the websocket event will contain your id.
* Events for create, update and delete of notes are shared by a websocket with the id of the note and the socketId if present. The client can then decide what he want to to with it.
* For the color switching CSS properties are used. (no big dom changes needed or complicate selectors)
* Handelbars is used for doing all the template rendering.
* There is a jquery-extension which allows the ajax-json-parser to identify date objects and convert them back to date objects instead of strings.
* UUID is used for creating unique IDs for all notes
* Everything in the application is set to the application namespace, there are no global definitions.
